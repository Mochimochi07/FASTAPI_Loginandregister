# FASTAPI_Loginandregister

This is a simple login and registration system I implemented using FastAPI and MySQL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FastAPI
- PyMySQL
- uvicorn 


> you get the host 127.0.0.1 when you make a new user in mysql workbench
> The name of the user made was Login Name (yes theres space in that)
> The password is yours to do just replace it.
> Schema name is login
> table name is users
> you know what columns you need to configure btwjust username and password for those two columns

## Twist

The code is dirty but simple. IF i mean dirty i really meant theres tons of bugs but this thing kinda works too.
